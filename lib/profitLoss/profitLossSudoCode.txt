Given TR, Coin, and AgI
  Fetch all coin trades for up to EoTR
  Fetch all coin prices in TR over AgI in USD

Create Array of timestamps over AgI in TR
  For Each Trade in TR (also need the last chunk of array)
  Slice arrays into ranges of time between trades (SoTR - < First Trade, >= Trade - < Trade || <= EoTR)
    or Order timestamps in chronollogical order, then slice off chunks where timestamp is before each trades

For each time range array
  With all previous trades
    Calculate Amount of Coin
    Calculate average cost of coin
    For each timestamp in array
      Use coin price data to caclulate percentage gain in USD

Merge timestamp arrays
Return Profit/Loss Data


** Definitions **
TR: Time Range
EoTR: End of Time Range
SoTR: Start of Time Range
AgI: Aggragate Interval
